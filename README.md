## Development Requirements

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)

To initialize the project, either load it using an IDE (Android Studio) with the
Flutter/Flutter Intl plugins, or run:

```shell script
flutter pub get
```

### Generating i18n files
These are not committed to git. If not using an IDE with Flutter Intl, run:

```shell script
flutter pub global activate intl_utils
flutter pub global run intl_utils:generate
```

### Generating JSON model boilerplate

Model from/to JSON boilerplate is generated by json_serializable.  
Since the models are not updated often, and the generation is slow, these
files are committed to git.

In order to regenerate these models (`lib/*.g.dart`), run:

```shell script
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Until the fix for https://github.com/dart-lang/build/issues/2835 is merged into master,
this may result in an "Unhandled Exception" about a missing `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/pubspec.yaml`.

As a workaround, manually create this file:
```shell script
mkdir -p .dart_tool/flutter_gen
echo "dependencies:" > .dart_tool/flutter_gen/pubspec.yaml
```

If any other issues remain, try:
```shell script
flutter pub cache repair
```
